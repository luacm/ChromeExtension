Chrome Extension

Intro to making a chrome extension

What is it?
============

An extension is a program that runs in your browser and interacts with the web pages you go to. In this workshop we will focus on Chrome Extensions, which are extensions made for the Chrome Browser. Firefox, Safari, and IE also support extension functionality but we'll focus on Chrome because its cooler.  

Some example extension to help you get the idea of the power are a [browser history timeline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-timeline/gjhpcfomcckgcaniehfgakaddjgncpeb) and a [to-do list](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-to-do-list-and-ta/fnibmbcdeepaahjmddiihohjanlimlmj/related). You can explore more extensions at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps). 


Why are we doing this?
