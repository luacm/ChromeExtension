Chrome Extension

Intro to making a chrome extension

What is it?
============

An extension is a program that runs in your browser and interacts with the web pages you go to. In this workshop we will focus on Chrome Extensions, which are extensions made for the Chrome Browser. Firefox, Safari, and IE also support extension functionality but we'll focus on Chrome because its cooler.  

Some example extension to help you get the idea of the power are a [browser history timeline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-timeline/gjhpcfomcckgcaniehfgakaddjgncpeb) and a [to-do list](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-to-do-list-and-ta/fnibmbcdeepaahjmddiihohjanlimlmj/related). You can explore more extensions at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps). 


Why are we doing this?
======================

So far we have explored HTML, CSS, and Javascript which is all it takes to make a Chrome Extension, and I think making a Chrome Extension is far cooler than making a HelloWorld website.

Plan
====

I'm going to walk you through making your first Chrome Extension; some topics I will cover are x, y, and z. Some topics I won't cover are a, b, and c. Google has a nice [beginner tutorial](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html) that you can take a look at; I plan on showing a lot more than what they do. 

Composition of a Chrome App
============================

### The Manifest

### Content Scripts

### Testing your app
* You can find all of your installed chrome apps on [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) and can load an unpublished extension into Chrome froms there
